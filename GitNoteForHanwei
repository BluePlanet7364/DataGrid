2. Open powershell, navigate to your folder's root. It is document/source/hanwei
3. Type command: git init  ---- this command is to establish a local git on your computer
4. Use command "git remote add origin https://github.com/BluePlanet7364/DataGrid.git"   --- This enable you to use "origin" as the code of your remote git repo

Good pactice:
